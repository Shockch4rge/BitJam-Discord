# **Yet Another Discord Music Bot**
Not much of a versatile Discord bot, but it helps me understand Javascript and event-based architecture using Node.js. Uses the Youtube Search API v3 for song querying, and discord.js v13 for Discord v9.

DEPRECATED: Refer to the updated TypeScript version [here].
